        I'm Kisanet Gabreselassie. I made this website because I know that all inequalities in education probhit students from reaching their full potential. Education is the key to the future, so there should not be predetermined barriers to a students education. Access to a quality education is fundemental to society and the most powerful weapons that we have in fighting ignorance, racism, sexism, and all other human rights issues.
