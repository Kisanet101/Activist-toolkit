       Remember that a high quality education is essential for all students and is a human right. No students should have their opportunity to sucess predetermined by their zipcode, circumstances they were born into, or the color of their skin. Even though true positive reform in the education system will be brought about through increased funding, improved teachers, more K-12 resources, and improved curriculum, you are still able to help make the education system in the United States more fair and equitable for everyone. There are simple things you can do to improve the education system in the United States!
      Reading an article, watching a ted talk, and discussing educatition inequality with a friend is a great way to help inform yourself and others about the American education system.
